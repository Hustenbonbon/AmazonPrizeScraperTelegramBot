# AmazonPrizeScraperTelegramBot
A Telegram bot that let's you register products on smile.amazon.de and checks their prices once per day.

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY, but uses a telegram bot instead of mail, where you can register products for check per command, and uses a scheduler instead of sleeping.

Work In Progress, what needs to be done:
* [ ] Delete registrations
* [ ] Show an overview of your registered products
* [ ] Maybe change it that it only tells you if the price changed
* [ ] Add instructions for deploying on a raspberry pi
